# 01 – Setup and Installation

This section explains how I installed and ran n8n, both in the cloud and locally with Docker.

##  Two Ways I Used to Run n8n

### 1. Cloud Version (n8n.io)

The easiest way to start is with the hosted version at [https://n8n.io](https://n8n.io)

- No installation required
- Free tier is available
- After a few workflows or executions per day – you might need to upgrade
- Great for beginners

 This is the version I used to build the first version of this automation.

### 2. Local Version (Docker)

You can also run n8n on your local machine using Docker:

####  Step-by-step:

1. Make sure you have Docker installed
2. Open **Git Bash** and run the following command:

```bash
docker run -it --rm \
  -p 5678:5678 \
  -v ~/.n8n:/home/node/.n8n \
  n8nio/n8n
```

3. Verify that the container is running:
```bash
docker ps
```

4. Open your browser at:
[http://localhost:5678](http://localhost:5678)

 This gives you full control – no limits, full flexibility.
