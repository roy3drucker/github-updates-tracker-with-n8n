# 02 â€“ Workflow Architecture

This folder contains a description of the n8n automation I built to monitor new or recently updated repositories from major tech companies on GitHub.

##  Workflow Structure

1. **Schedule Trigger** â€“ Triggers the flow once a day
2. **HTTP Request** â€“ Pulls data from GitHub API for Microsoft and Google
3. **Merge Node** â€“ Combines both responses
4. **IF Node** â€“ Filters repositories updated today
5. **Edit Fields (Set)** â€“ Prepares a summary text for each item and then unifies all into one
6. **Gmail** â€“ Sends a single email with the full summary

##  Node Explanations

| Node          | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| Schedule      | Runs once a day at 08:00 AM |
| HTTP Request 1| Sends a GET request to: https://api.github.com/orgs/microsoft/repos?per_page=1&sort=updated |
| HTTP Request 2| Sends a GET request to: https://api.github.com/orgs/google/repos?per_page=1&sort=updated |
| Merge         | Combines both responses into one item list |
| IF            | Checks if `updated_at` contains today's date |
| Edit Fields   | Creates field `email_body` and joins all summaries into one block of text |
| Gmail         | Sends one email with the combined summary |
